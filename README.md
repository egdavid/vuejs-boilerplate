### Introduction

This boilerplate provides a decent quick start for a brand new project and is built on a Vue CLI + Vue Bootstrap 4.3 foundation. It's based on my own experiences and needs. You might be finding some useful things and some useless, so, just take what you need.

If you're more looking for a production ready boilerplate, I advise you to consider using [Vuesion](https://github.com/vuesion/vuesion). You could also consider using the [Nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org) framework.

But if you're starting with Vue.js or JavaScript or even with code in general or if you just need a skeleton, mine could be a good start.

### How to get started

```
clone https://github.com/egdavid/vuejs-boilerplate <project-name>
cd <project-name>
npm install
npm run serve
```

The app is browsable under the `http://localhost:8080/` url.

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Contributing

I've created this boilerplate for my own purposes but if you feel like you want to contribute and improve it, then feel free to do it!

### Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within this boilerplate, please create a pull request if possible. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

### ToDo

- Create a Wiki to describe the project, installed packages and the specs (axios repository, vuex store modules)
- Implement Cypress tests
- Add comments, more comments!

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
